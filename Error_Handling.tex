\chapter{Error Handling}\label{error-handling}

There are multiple existing systems of error handling. For example, one
established way to pass errors in C is to return ``error code'' values
as integers. When using this function, a \texttt{0} is considered a successful
return, and any other value is considered an error.

It is prudent to devise and follow and error handling and checking
system to use in all programs.

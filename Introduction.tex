\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
When programming, it is essential for all programmers on a project to follow a
common style. Doing so ensures consistency and productivity, allowing for a
final product which is better functioning and more appealing to the client.
A consistent style and detailed documentation will allow colleagues and future
programmers to easily understand and use new source code.

This style guide is intended to provide a unifying basis for programming in the
C programming language, and to provide a standard for documenting the programs
created.
